 Dear Mr. Cruz,
 I would like to formally request a leave of absence from work starting November 4,

 attention. I have ensured that all my current tasks and responsibilities are either
 completed or properly delegated to my team members before my leave.
 Please let me know if there are any documents or forms I need to complete to
 process this request. I will make sure to return to work promptly on November 10,
 2025.
 Thank you very much for your kind consideration.

 Sincerely,
